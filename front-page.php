                            Mathematics might not be the favorite 
                            school subject for some, it is involved

                            participate. In cooking, for example, 
                            we must be able to measure and convert 
                            units so that we can create the perfect 
                            recipe. In building a house, we must be 
                            able to calculate areas and other measurements 
                            to construct buildings that will withstand 
                            nature’s forces.
